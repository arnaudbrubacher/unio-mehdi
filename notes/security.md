In Agora we put voter's privacy and election's integrity first. We follow the Presumed Security school of thought. On that matter, we use certified open-source voting codes at the core of our voting system designs. We utilize strong privacy-preserving techniques such as Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZK), threshold key generation ceremony and asymmetric encryption to keep your votes secure and anonymous. For the verifiability of the election, we provide the essential election data in "NIST Special Publication 1500-100 revision 2.0" format to enable any third party to audit the election without breaking voter's privacy. We are constantly researching on online voting field and keep testing and improving our voting system designs. 


In Agora, our foremost priorities lie in safeguarding both the privacy of voters and the integrity of elections. Guided by the principles of the Presumed Security paradigm, we have integrated certified open-source voting codes at the heart of our voting system frameworks. Our approach embraces robust privacy-preserving techniques, including Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZK), threshold key generation ceremonies, and asymmetric encryption, all of which combine to ensure the utmost security and anonymity for your votes.

To ensure the transparency and verifiability of each election, we furnish essential election data in compliance with the "NIST Special Publication 1500-100 revision 2.0" format. This empowers third parties to conduct audits on the election process without compromising the privacy of voters. Continuously committed to the advancement of online voting, we maintain an ongoing pursuit of academic research, testing, and enhancement within the realm of our voting system designs.
